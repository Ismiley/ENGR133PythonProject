Instructions:
Run "Sobel_Edge_Detection.py"
Enter a filename of a colored .png image
Enter a value for the variance and dimensions for a Gaussian distribution kernel

Included in newest version:
1.4
-threshold value is now dinamically calculated
-user has the option to enter a new threshold value manually if not satisfied
-error handling in threshold program
KNOWN ISSUES:
-program is very slow in general
-time elapsed in thresholding does not reflect processing time

Previous Versions
1.3
-removed the sciPy library from third step
-patched the communication discrepency between step 3 and 4
KNOWN ISSUES:
-threshold program uses static threshold value

1.2
-Added image step outputs for each subtask
-fixed crashing grayscale program
KNOWN ISSUES:
-third step uses sciPy library
-fourth step expects 3d matrix, third step returns 2d
-threshold program takes no user input

1.1
-Added timer functionality and verbose output
-patched error between steps 3 and 4
KNOWN ISSUES:
-third step uses SciPy library
-Invalid Input crashes grayscale program
-fourth step expects 3d matrix, third step returns 2d
-threshold program takes no user input

1.0
-initial upload of program
KNOWN ISSUES:
-error passing data between third and fourth steps
-third step uses SciPy library
-Invalid input crashes grayscale program
-Threshold program takes no user input
